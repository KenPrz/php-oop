# Comprehensive PHP with SQL Refresher Course

## Course Overview
This course is designed to refresh your knowledge of PHP Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and SQL integration. Each module contains theory, code examples, and practical exercises to reinforce your learning.

## Module 1: PHP OOP Basics

### Lesson 1.1: Classes and Objects
- Theory: Understanding classes and objects
- Example: Creating a basic class and instantiating objects
- Exercise: Create a `Person` class with properties and methods

### Lesson 1.2: Constructor and Destructor
- Theory: Role of constructors and destructors
- Example: Implementing constructor and destructor methods
- Exercise: Modify the `Person` class to include a constructor and destructor

### Lesson 1.3: Inheritance
- Theory: Concept of inheritance in OOP
- Example: Creating parent and child classes
- Exercise: Create a `Student` class that inherits from the `Person` class

### Lesson 1.4: Encapsulation
- Theory: Understanding encapsulation and access modifiers
- Example: Using public, private, and protected access modifiers
- Exercise: Implement getters and setters in the `Person` class

### Lesson 1.5: Polymorphism
- Theory: Polymorphism through method overriding and interfaces
- Example: Demonstrating method overriding and interface implementation
- Exercise: Create an interface `Printable` and implement it in multiple classes

### Lesson 1.6: Abstract Classes and Static Members
- Theory: Abstract classes and static properties/methods
- Example: Creating an abstract class and using static members
- Exercise: Implement an abstract `Shape` class with static properties

## Module 2: Advanced PHP OOP Concepts

### Lesson 2.1: Traits
- Theory: Understanding and using traits
- Example: Creating and using a trait in multiple classes
- Exercise: Implement a `Loggable` trait and use it in your classes

### Lesson 2.2: Namespaces
- Theory: Organizing code with namespaces
- Example: Defining and using namespaces
- Exercise: Reorganize your classes into appropriate namespaces

### Lesson 2.3: Exception Handling
- Theory: Exception handling in PHP
- Example: Using try-catch blocks and throwing exceptions
- Exercise: Implement exception handling in your `Person` class methods

### Lesson 2.4: Magic Methods
- Theory: PHP magic methods and their uses
- Example: Implementing `__toString()`, `__get()`, and `__set()` methods
- Exercise: Add magic methods to your `Student` class

## Module 3: SQL Basics and Database Interaction

### Lesson 3.1: SQL Fundamentals
- Theory: Basic SQL commands (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Example: Writing simple SQL queries
- Exercise: Create a `users` table and write queries to manipulate data

### Lesson 3.2: PHP Database Connectivity
- Theory: Connecting to databases using PHP (MySQLi and PDO)
- Example: Establishing a database connection and executing queries
- Exercise: Create a `DatabaseConnection` class using PDO

### Lesson 3.3: CRUD Operations
- Theory: Implementing Create, Read, Update, Delete operations
- Example: Writing PHP functions for CRUD operations
- Exercise: Implement CRUD operations for the `Person` class using the database

## Module 4: Advanced SQL and PHP Integration

### Lesson 4.1: Prepared Statements
- Theory: Using prepared statements for security
- Example: Implementing prepared statements with PDO
- Exercise: Refactor your CRUD operations to use prepared statements

### Lesson 4.2: Transactions
- Theory: Understanding database transactions
- Example: Implementing transactions in PHP
- Exercise: Add transaction support to your `DatabaseConnection` class

### Lesson 4.3: Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
- Theory: Introduction to ORM concepts
- Example: Creating a simple ORM system
- Exercise: Implement a basic ORM for your `Person` and `Student` classes

## Final Project
Create a small web application that demonstrates your understanding of PHP OOP and SQL integration. The application should:

1. Allow users to perform CRUD operations on `Person` and `Student` objects
2. Implement proper error handling and data validation
3. Use namespaces to organize your code
4. Implement at least one trait and one interface
5. Use prepared statements for all database interactions
6. Include at least one transaction for a complex operation
